**(Phase 2: Exploring Future Strategies - Breakout Sessions - 60 mins)**

*   **[30-35 mins] Breakout Session Introduction & Task Briefing (Facilitator):**
    *   Divide participants into 4 breakout groups (5 people each, mix of roles).
    *   Assign each group a specific focus area related to the strategic challenge:

**Visual Content Progression (Across the Workshop):**

*   **Start:** Blank SWOT template, blank breakout group whiteboards, blank Priority Matrix.
*   **Phase 1:** SWOT template filled with sticky notes, Market Analysis slide.
*   **Phase 2:** Breakout group whiteboards filled with notes, frameworks (Business Model Canvas etc.), diagrams.
*   **Phase 3:** Breakout group whiteboards presented, Priority Matrix populated with prioritized ideas, main whiteboard summarizing key points.
*   **Phase 4:** Final state of all whiteboards captured, potentially a roadmap visualization summarizing prioritized actions over time.

## Implementation Plan for Synthetic Materials Generation:

**1. Transcript Generation (LLM-Driven Script):**

*   **Persona Development:**
    *   Create detailed profiles for each of the 20 participants (CEO, CFO, Head of Marketing, etc.).
    *   Define their typical communication style (assertive, analytical, collaborative, etc.), level of detail, and areas of expertise.
    *   Example Persona Detail (Head of Sustainability):
        *   *Name:*  Sarah Chen
        *   *Role:* Head of Sustainability
        *   *Communication Style:*  Data-driven, passionate, sometimes technical, collaborative.
        *   *Expertise:*  Sustainability regulations, circular economy principles, material science, environmental impact assessment.
        *   *Typical Contributions:*  Provides data on environmental impact, advocates for sustainable solutions, raises concerns about greenwashing risks, suggests specific certifications and standards.

*   **Script Writing (Iterative Process with LLM):**
    *   **Stage 1: Agenda-Based Outline:**  Feed the workshop agenda to the LLM and ask it to generate dialogue for each section, considering the workshop flow and objectives.
    *   **Stage 2: Persona Integration:**  Prompt the LLM to rewrite the dialogue, assigning lines to specific personas based on their roles and profiles.  Instruct the LLM to incorporate their defined communication styles and expertise.
    *   **Stage 3: Workshop Dynamics & Realism:**  Prompt the LLM to add realistic workshop elements:
        *   Topic changes and transitions.
        *   Interruptions and overlaps in speech.
        *   Side discussions and clarifications.
        *   Questions from participants.
        *   Moments of agreement and disagreement.
        *   Humor or informal language where appropriate.
        *   Explicit decision points and action items as outlined in the agenda.
        *   Discussions around risks and opportunities related to the strategic challenge.
        *   Breakout session dynamics - initial confusion, focused discussion, reporting back.
    *   **Stage 4: Strategic Framework Integration:**  Ensure the script explicitly mentions and discusses strategic frameworks (SWOT, Business Model Canvas, Priority Matrix) at the appropriate points in the agenda.  Include references to visual elements (e.g., "Let's put 'Competitor X's aggressive pricing' under Threats in our SWOT").
    *   **Stage 5: Review and Refinement:** Manually review the generated script for:
        *   Realism of dialogue and workshop flow.
        *   Consistency of persona voices.
        *   Coverage of strategic concepts and frameworks.
        *   Clear decision points and action items.
        *   Logical progression of ideas and conclusions.
        *   Adjust and refine the LLM prompts or manually edit the script as needed to improve quality.

*   **Transcript Formatting:**  Format the final script into a readable transcript, clearly labeling speakers for each dialogue turn.  Consider adding timestamps for each section/phase to align with potential audio later.

**2. Text-based Materials (Facilitator & Participant):**

*   **Facilitator Notes:**
    *   **Workshop Agenda & Objectives Document:** Create a simple document outlining the agenda and workshop objectives (as defined in the outline above).
    *   **Facilitator Guide:**  Create a more detailed guide for the "facilitator" (CEO persona), outlining the workshop flow, key questions to ask in each section, and prompts for guiding the discussion.
    *   **Template Worksheets:**  Use the digital framework templates created above (SWOT, Business Model Canvas, Priority Matrix, Breakout Session Instructions).

*   **Participant Contributions (Optional for initial phase - can be added later for more complexity):**
    *   **Individual Notes:**  Generate short, simulated "notes" from a few participants, reflecting their key takeaways or questions during the workshop. These can be simple text files.
    *   **Pre-workshop Homework Submissions:**  If desired, simulate very brief "pre-workshop" submissions (e.g., a few bullet points from each participant on their initial thoughts on the strategic challenge - can be simple text files).
    *   **Post-workshop Feedback:**  Generate short, simulated feedback comments from participants (e.g., "Good session, but we could have spent more time on digital strategy" - simple text files).

**3. Quality Assurance:**

*   **Strategy Workshop Expert Review:**  Ideally, have someone with experience in facilitating or participating in strategy workshops review the generated materials (transcript, visuals) for realism and plausibility.
*   **Realism Check:**  Specifically check if:
    *   The workshop flow makes sense.
    *   The dialogue is realistic for a strategy workshop setting.
    *   The strategic frameworks are used appropriately.
    *   The visual content aligns with the transcript and workshop progression.
    *   There are no obvious unrealistic content patterns that could bias AI analysis.
*   **Variety and Diversity:**  Ensure there is sufficient variety in:
    *   Discussion topics and viewpoints.
    *   Communication styles of participants.
    *   Visual formats and content on whiteboards.

By following this detailed outline and implementation plan, you can generate a comprehensive set of synthetic workshop data (transcripts and visuals) suitable for testing your AI-driven analysis system. Remember to iterate and refine the process based on quality assurance feedback and the specific needs of your AI testing.
