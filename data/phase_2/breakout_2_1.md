**(0:17:30) Breakout Session 1: Circular Business Models (Group 1)**

**(0:17:30) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Okay, Group 1, Circular Business Models. Eleanor mentioned using the Business Model Canvas for Circularity. Has anyone used that framework in detail before? I've reviewed it, but I'm wondering how applicable it is to fashion specifically.

**(0:17:36) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** I've used the standard canvas extensively, and I've played around with the circular adaptations.

**(0:17:40) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Are we talking about that nine-box grid thing? With the value proposition in the middle?

**(0:17:43) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Exactly. The core idea is shifting from a linear "take-make-dispose" model to a closed-loop system. It helps us think about value creation, delivery, and capture in a circular context.

**(0:17:51) Marcus Chen (CFO):** But does it actually work for fashion? Our industry has some unique challenges.

**(0:17:54) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** From a design perspective, I find it quite helpful actually. It forces us to consider the end-of-life of our garments from the very beginning of the design process.

**(0:18:01) Marcus Chen (CFO):** End-of-life meaning...?

**(0:18:03) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Whether we're designing for durability, repairability, recyclability... The canvas helps map out the entire ecosystem, from sourcing to customer use and then back into the cycle.

**(0:18:12) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** It's more of a mindset shift and structured brainstorming tool than a rigid step-by-step guide.

**(0:18:16) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Okay, sounds good conceptually, but how do we make this tangible for Sustainable Fashion Co.? Where do we actually start?

**(0:18:22) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customers are already asking about rental and recycling options.

**(0:18:25) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Right. We listed rental, resale, repair, and recycling in the briefing. Maybe we should tackle them one by one and flesh out the practicalities?

**(0:18:32) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Agreed, let's get practical. Let's start with **rental**. Is a rental model even remotely feasible for our brand, given our price points and target customer?

**(0:18:40) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** I think rental has potential, but not for everything we make.

**(0:18:43) Marcus Chen (CFO):** What product categories would make sense?

**(0:18:45) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** High-value items like occasion wear, outerwear, maybe even capsule collections of versatile basics. For everyday fast-fashion type items, it's probably less appealing from both customer perspective and operational standpoint.

**(0:18:55) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customers definitely ask about occasion wear rental. Wedding guest outfits, formal events, that sort of thing.

**(0:19:00) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Design for durability becomes paramount for rental. We'd need to use inherently robust materials, reinforced seams, maybe even develop modular designs where components can be easily replaced if damaged.

**(0:19:08) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** From an operations standpoint, rental is honestly a nightmare.

**(0:19:11) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** That's a bit strong, isn't it?

**(0:19:13) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Well, think about it. Managing reverse logistics – getting rented items back efficiently. Professional cleaning and sanitization between rentals. Inventory management for rental items – tracking availability, predicting demand...

**(0:19:23) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Plus the financial implications of damage.

**(0:19:25) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Exactly. Who's financially responsible for wear and tear or significant damage? Would we need a deposit system? Insurance policies? It adds significant complexity at the store level, requiring new training for staff and potentially dedicated rental service areas.

**(0:19:36) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** From a customer service perspective, rental introduces entirely new touchpoints and potential friction points. Customers will have questions about cleaning, damage policies, rental periods, late fees...

**(0:19:45) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** All solvable problems though, right?

**(0:19:47) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Sure, but we'd need incredibly clear and transparent rental terms to build trust and avoid disputes. Hygiene is a major concern for customers with rentals.

**(0:19:54) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Especially post-COVID.

**(0:19:56) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Right. We'd need to communicate our cleaning processes explicitly. Pricing is also critical – the rental price needs to feel significantly lower than the purchase price to incentivize rental, but still be profitable for us.

**(0:20:04) Marcus Chen (CFO):** The financial modeling for rental is actually quite complex. We'd need to analyze potential revenue streams from rental fees, late fees, damage charges, versus the operational costs – cleaning, logistics, inventory management, potential losses from damage or unreturned items...

**(0:20:16) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** It sounds like we're all pointing out problems rather than solutions.

**(0:20:19) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Fair point. Are there comparable brands successfully operating rental models at scale?

**(0:20:23) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Rent the Runway is the obvious example, but they're rental-first. For traditional retailers adding rental, the picture is mixed.

**(0:20:29) Marcus Chen (CFO):** And what about utilization rates? How often are rental items actually rented out? Low utilization quickly erodes profitability.

**(0:20:35) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** To mitigate the initial risks and complexities, we could explore a phased approach. Start with a pilot program focused on a limited product category – perhaps occasion wear dresses or outerwear – and a small number of flagship stores in key urban markets.

**(0:20:46) Marcus Chen (CFO):** That makes sense. Testing before fully committing.

**(0:20:49) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** And partnering with an existing rental platform could be smart for the pilot phase. Instead of building our own from scratch, we could leverage the technology and operational expertise of a rental specialist like Rent the Runway.

**(0:20:58) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Would they be interested in partnering with us? We're not luxury level.

**(0:21:01) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** There are mid-market rental platforms too. This approach would allow us to test the model in a lower-risk environment, gather real-world data on customer demand and operational challenges before making a larger investment.

**(0:21:10) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** If we did a pilot, stores with larger footprints and higher customer traffic would be ideal for managing rental inventory and providing dedicated rental service areas.

**(0:21:18) Marcus Chen (CFO):** What about staff training?

**(0:21:20) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** We'd need to invest in training store staff specifically on rental operations – handling bookings, processing returns, managing cleaning protocols. Maybe designate specific staff members as "rental specialists" to ensure quality service.

**(0:21:31) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** For the pilot collection, we should design specifically for rental from the outset. Focus on durable, timeless designs that are less trend-dependent and have broad appeal.

**(0:21:39) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** And they need to be easy to clean!

**(0:21:41) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Absolutely. Select robust, easy-to-clean fabrics that can withstand multiple washes. Incorporate reinforced seams, durable closures, and modular elements for ease of repair.

**(0:21:49) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** We could even use QR codes on rental garments to link to care instructions, repair tutorials, and track rental history and cleaning cycles.

**(0:21:56) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customers would appreciate that transparency.

**(0:21:59) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Okay, so for rental – a phased pilot approach focused on specific product categories and flagship stores, potentially partnering with an existing platform, and rigorous financial analysis of performance. Let's move to **resale**, which seems to be gaining significant momentum in the market. What are the most promising resale strategies for us?

**(0:22:13) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Resale is definitely lower-hanging fruit and potentially a faster route to circularity. We could launch our own branded resale platform – an online marketplace specifically for pre-owned Sustainable Fashion Co. garments.

**(0:22:24) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Build our own platform or partner with existing ones?

**(0:22:27) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Having our own would allow us to directly control the brand experience and capture a larger share of the resale value. We could implement in-store take-back programs, encouraging customers to return their used items in exchange for store credit.

**(0:22:38) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** That would drive foot traffic to physical stores and incentivize repeat purchases.

**(0:22:42) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Exactly. We could curate the pre-owned inventory, authenticate items to build trust, and potentially offer cleaning and refurbishment services.

**(0:22:49) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** In-store take-back for resale aligns perfectly with our retail strategy. It creates a tangible circularity touchpoint within our physical stores.

**(0:22:55) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** We could designate a "pre-loved" section within stores to showcase resale items.

**(0:22:59) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Yes! Create a curated boutique-like experience that elevates the perception of resale. Visual merchandising would be critical – using premium displays, attractive lighting, styled mannequins.

**(0:23:07) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customers love the treasure hunt aspect of finding unique pre-owned pieces.

**(0:23:11) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** And offering store credit for returned items drives immediate sales in our stores. Staff would need training on how to assess the condition of returned items and manage the resale inventory.

**(0:23:19) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Design for longevity becomes even more crucial for resale success. We should emphasize classic styles, durable fabrics, and high-quality construction so our garments hold their value longer.

**(0:23:28) Marcus Chen (CFO):** What about authentication? Counterfeits could be an issue.

**(0:23:31) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** We'd need authentication services, either in-house or through a third-party specialist. We could also design specific packaging for resale items – eco-friendly packaging that highlights the pre-loved status while maintaining a premium feel.

**(0:23:42) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Collaborating with resale influencers to promote the platform could generate significant buzz.

**(0:23:46) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customer communication is key for a successful resale program. We need to clearly communicate the benefits – both environmental and economic – and develop clear guidelines on what condition items are accepted in.

**(0:23:56) Marcus Chen (CFO):** How do we determine pricing for pre-loved items?

**(0:23:59) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** That's tricky. Do we use a fixed discount percentage off the original retail price, or a more dynamic model based on condition, demand, and market value?

**(0:24:05) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Financially, resale seems more attractive than rental in the short term. Lower operational complexity, potentially faster time to market, and more established customer demand. The margins will likely be lower than new product sales, but the inventory acquisition cost is also substantially lower.

**(0:24:18) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Practically free inventory, since we're acquiring used garments from existing customers.

**(0:24:22) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Exactly. We need to model potential profitability of different approaches – in-house platform versus partnering, online-only versus omnichannel resale, different pricing structures.

**(0:24:31) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** A hybrid approach might be most effective. Partner with an established resale platform like ThredUp initially to launch quickly and leverage their existing customer base and infrastructure.

**(0:24:40) Marcus Chen (CFO):** While simultaneously developing our own branded platform for the longer term?

**(0:24:44) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Precisely. Partnering allows us to test the market with minimal upfront investment and risk, learn from an experienced partner, and generate early revenue. Over time, we transition towards a fully branded in-house solution.

**(0:24:55) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** That makes a lot of sense. Integrating with a resale partner initially could also simplify in-store take-back operations. We could focus on the customer-facing aspects while outsourcing the complex back-end operations.

**(0:25:03) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Branding for the resale program is a critical consideration. Do we integrate resale seamlessly into our main brand, or create a separate sub-brand with its own distinct identity?

**(0:25:12) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customers might respond better to a sub-brand. It creates some separation between new and pre-owned.

**(0:25:17) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** A separate sub-brand could appeal to a different customer segment specifically interested in pre-owned fashion, while still maintaining a clear link to the parent brand.

**(0:25:25) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Brand identity for resale is definitely crucial. It needs to resonate with our target customer and reinforce our values. Let's move to **repair services**. In Phase 1 SWOT, we identified inconsistent in-store experience as a weakness. Repair services could directly enhance customer perception of product durability and our commitment to longevity. What are the most effective ways to expand and promote repairs?

**(0:25:44) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Expanding in-store repair services is a fantastic opportunity to enhance the customer experience and create differentiation.

**(0:25:50) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** But do we have the expertise in-house?

**(0:25:53) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** We'd need to hire or train repair specialists. We could establish dedicated in-store repair stations in flagship locations, offering a range of services – from simple hemming and button replacements to more complex repairs like zipper replacements and fabric mending.

**(0:26:05) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** What's the spatial requirement for a repair station?

**(0:26:08) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Not huge, maybe 100 square feet. We'd promote repair services prominently with clear signage, service menus, and transparent pricing. Offer while-you-wait service for minor repairs and drop-off for complex ones.

**(0:26:19) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** The repair stations could become a visual feature, showcasing the process and highlighting our commitment to craftsmanship.

**(0:26:25) Marcus Chen (CFO):** I like that. It's tangible evidence of our sustainability commitment.

**(0:26:28) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Design for repairability from the outset is essential to make repair services more efficient and cost-effective. We could use simpler construction methods, easily replaceable components, and provide clear repair guides or even DIY kits with purchase.

**(0:26:40) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** DIY kits would be extremely popular. Customers are increasingly interested in extending product life themselves.

**(0:26:46) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** We could also design with visible mending in mind, incorporating elements that celebrate repair and make it part of the aesthetic, rather than hiding it.

**(0:26:54) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** That's quite a mindset shift for customers though.

**(0:26:57) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** It is, but it's happening. Look at the visible mending movement on social media. It shifts perception of repair from something negative to something positive – extending product life and adding character.

**(0:27:05) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Proactive communication and promotion of repair services are crucial. We need prominent placement on our website, in email marketing, social media, and in-store signage.

**(0:27:13) Marcus Chen (CFO):** And train customer service teams?

**(0:27:15) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Absolutely. They should be knowledgeable about our repair services and proactively offer solutions to customers with garment issues. Make it easy to access repairs – clear instructions on booking appointments, finding locations, or accessing DIY guides.

**(0:27:27) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** We could offer different tiers of repair services too – basic repairs, premium repairs, tailoring and customization.

**(0:27:33) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** And maybe free basic repairs for loyal customers or within a warranty period.

**(0:27:37) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Beyond in-store repair stations, we could explore more innovative delivery models – mobile repair services, pop-up repair stations at events, even a repair van that visits different neighborhoods.

**(0:27:47) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** A repair van? Is that realistic?

**(0:27:50) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Several brands are trying it. We could also partner with local repair businesses to expand our network and offer services where we don't have physical stores.

**(0:27:57) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Local partnerships would be great for community building too.

**(0:28:00) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** We could develop a subscription-based repair service for loyal customers – offering unlimited or discounted repairs for a monthly fee, creating a recurring revenue stream.

**(0:28:08) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Interesting concept. The financial viability of expanded repair services needs careful analysis. While repairs may not be a major revenue generator, they contribute to loyalty, brand image, and product longevity, which indirectly drives profitability.

**(0:28:20) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Should repair services be profit-centered or break-even?

**(0:28:24) Marcus Chen (CFO):** That's the key question. Are customers willing to pay for premium repair services? Should repairs be a profit center, a break-even service to enhance value, or a subsidized service as part of our sustainability strategy? We need to define the strategic objectives and align the financial model accordingly.

**(0:28:39) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** We could test different models in different markets.

**(0:28:42) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Good idea. Finally, let's discuss **recycling**. We currently have a very basic take-back program, but it's not very effective or visible. How can we create a truly impactful recycling system?

**(0:28:52) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Improving our in-store textile take-back program is a priority. We need to make it more prominent, convenient, and transparent.

**(0:28:59) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Most customers don't even know it exists.

**(0:29:01) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Exactly. We need dedicated, clearly labeled recycling bins in all stores, easily accessible and visually appealing. Promotional signage and messaging to raise awareness and encourage participation.

**(0:29:11) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** And clear instructions on what can be recycled and how to prepare items.

**(0:29:15) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Yes, and we should track the volume collected and communicate the impact to customers – how many garments diverted from landfill, how much material recycled, etc.

**(0:29:23) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Incentives would help drive participation – discounts on future purchases, loyalty points, or charitable donations for each garment recycled.

**(0:29:30) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Transparency and traceability are absolutely crucial for building trust. We need to partner with reputable textile recyclers and ensure the garments we collect are actually being recycled, not just downcycled or landfilled.

**(0:29:41) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Do such partners exist? I mean, textiles are notoriously difficult to recycle effectively.

**(0:29:46) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** It's a challenge, but there are innovations happening. We need to map the entire recycling process and communicate it clearly to customers – from collection to sorting, processing, and end-use of recycled materials.

**(0:29:56) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** We could explore closed-loop systems for specific product lines, where we take back our own garments and recycle them into new products.

**(0:30:02) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Exactly. And investigate innovative technologies – chemical recycling, enzymatic recycling – that can handle mixed fibers more effectively.

**(0:30:09) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** From a design perspective, we need to prioritize recyclability. That means using mono-materials whenever possible – 100% cotton, 100% polyester – as they're much easier to recycle than blends.

**(0:30:19) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** But blends often perform better. There's a reason we use them.

**(0:30:23) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** True, it's a trade-off. We'd need to minimize complex trims and embellishments that complicate recycling and design for easy disassembly to separate materials.

**(0:30:31) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** What about garment passports? Digital tags embedded in garments with detailed information about materials, dyes, and end-of-life instructions.

**(0:30:38) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** That would be fascinating! We'd need to collaborate with recyclers and material scientists to ensure our designs are compatible with the latest recycling technologies.

**(0:30:46) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customer education about textile recycling is vital. Many customers are confused about what happens to recycled clothes and whether it's actually effective.

**(0:30:53) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** Or they think everything they donate gets reused, when much of it is actually downcycled or landfilled.

**(0:30:58) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Exactly. We need clear information about recycling processes, benefits, and our program's impact. Address myths and misconceptions and build trust through transparency and data-backed claims.

**(0:31:07) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Recycling, especially advanced textile recycling, is currently complex, costly, and not widely scaled. It's a crucial long-term investment, but the economics are challenging.

**(0:31:15) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Are there government subsidies or incentives available?

**(0:31:18) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Good question. We should explore government subsidies, tax incentives, or extended producer responsibility schemes to offset costs. The financial model may not be immediately profitable, but the long-term benefits for brand reputation, regulatory compliance, and environmental impact are significant.

**(0:31:33) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** It's also future-proofing against increasingly likely regulation in this space.

**(0:31:37) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Good point. We've covered rental, resale, repair, and recycling very thoroughly. Are there other circular approaches we should touch on before summarizing?

**(0:31:45) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Product-as-a-service models are still niche in fashion but have potential. Subscription boxes for curated clothing selections, offering regular deliveries of new styles for a monthly fee, could appeal to customers seeking convenience without ownership.

**(0:31:56) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Like a "fashion Netflix"?

**(0:31:58) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Exactly. Leasing models for corporate uniforms or workwear could be relevant for B2B customers. These models shift from ownership to access and service, potentially generating recurring revenue.

**(0:32:07) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Collaborative consumption models like clothing libraries or swaps within communities align with circular principles too, though they're less directly revenue-generating.

**(0:32:15) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** We could support or partner with existing clothing libraries rather than launching our own.

**(0:32:19) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** Absolutely. And focusing on product durability and timeless design is itself a fundamental circular strategy. Making clothes that last, both in quality and style, reduces the overall consumption cycle and waste.

**(0:32:30) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** Customers increasingly value durability, but we need to better communicate its importance. Highlight the long-term value of investing in quality versus the disposability of fast fashion.

**(0:32:39) Marcus Chen (CFO):** These are all excellent points. We've explored rental, resale, repair, recycling, and service models thoroughly. Liam, could you start summarizing our key takeaways and recommendations on the whiteboard?

**(0:32:49) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Sure thing.

**(0:32:51) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Let's prioritize the most impactful and feasible options for the short to medium term. Resale and repair seem like strong initial focus areas, while rental, advanced recycling, and product-as-a-service need more in-depth study and phased implementation.

**(0:33:02) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Agreed. Product durability and customer education are overarching strategies that support everything else.

**(0:33:07) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Let's aim for 3-5 key recommendations with concrete action items and metrics for each. Perhaps we can start by summarizing for resale – what are the key actions for launching a successful program?

**(0:33:16) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** For resale, I'd suggest: 1. Conduct detailed market analysis and competitive benchmarking of existing platforms. 2. Decide on the optimal model – in-house versus partnering, or hybrid. 3. Develop a comprehensive operational plan for inventory, authentication, cleaning, pricing, and logistics.

**(0:33:31) Marcus Chen (CFO):** What about the brand strategy?

**(0:33:33) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** 4. Create a compelling brand identity and marketing strategy to attract sellers and buyers. 5. Define key metrics – sales volume, customer acquisition cost, satisfaction, and environmental impact.

**(0:33:43) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** From a design perspective for resale: 1. Reinforce design focus on durability and timeless styles for all new product lines to enhance resale value. 2. Develop guidelines for garment care and repair to extend lifespan. 3. Explore innovations for authentication and traceability, like unique identifiers or digital passports.

**(0:33:58) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** For retail operations: 1. Pilot in-store take-back programs in select flagship stores, offering store credit as incentives. 2. Designate "pre-loved" sections with premium visual merchandising. 3. Train staff on resale operations and customer service.

**(0:34:09) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** For customer communication: 1. Develop clear terms and conditions addressing condition guidelines, pricing, returns, and authentication. 2. Create FAQs for customer service teams. 3. Launch a comprehensive marketing campaign highlighting benefits and ease of participation.

**(0:34:22) Marcus Chen (CFO):** Excellent, those are concrete action items for resale. Let's continue this process for repair services, recycling, and our other priority areas. We'll create a structured implementation plan with clear ownership, timelines, and success metrics for each initiative.
