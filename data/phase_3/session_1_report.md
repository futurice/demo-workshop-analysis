**(1:35:00) Phase 3: Breakout Group Report-Back & Discussion**

**(1:35:00) Eleanor Vance (CEO):** Welcome back, everyone! I hope your breakout sessions were productive. Now we're going to hear from each group about what you've discussed and developed. This is where the real magic happens – when we bring these different perspectives together. We'll take about 5-7 minutes for each group's presentation, followed by discussion. Group 1, let's start with you – Circular Business Models. Liam, I believe you're presenting?

**(1:35:15) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** *[standing and moving to the front with his laptop]* Thanks, Eleanor. We had a really productive discussion in our breakout session exploring how Sustainable Fashion Co. can implement circularity across our business model. We structured our discussion around the four key circular strategies: rental, resale, repair, and recycling.

**(1:35:30) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** *[sharing screen with a summary slide]* Let me start with our key recommendations and then I'll dive deeper into each area. Our group identified resale and repair as the most immediately impactful and feasible circular strategies to pursue in the short term, with rental and advanced recycling requiring more study and phased implementation.

**(1:35:45) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** For **resale**, we recommend launching a branded "pre-loved" program, starting with a phased approach. Initially, we'd partner with an established resale platform like ThredUp to leverage their infrastructure while we learn. This would involve in-store take-back programs incentivized with store credit, which Maria pointed out would drive additional foot traffic and repeat purchases.

**(1:36:02) Marcus Chen (CFO):** *[interjecting]* If I could just add that our financial analysis suggested this approach minimizes upfront investment while still allowing us to test customer demand.

**(1:36:10) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Exactly, Marcus. We'd then transition to a fully-branded in-house solution once proven. Isabelle highlighted the importance of designing for longevity from the outset to enhance resale value – using durable materials, timeless styles, and high-quality construction. 

**(1:36:23) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** For **repair services**, we recommend significantly expanding our current limited offering. This includes establishing dedicated repair stations in flagship stores, offering tiered service levels from basic repairs to premium customization, and developing DIY repair kits for customers who want to fix items themselves.

**(1:36:40) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** *[changing to next slide]* For **rental**, we identified significant operational challenges but still see potential. Our recommendation is a careful pilot program limited to high-value categories like occasion wear and outerwear in select urban flagship stores. This pilot would help us learn about logistical challenges like cleaning, inventory management, and damage policies before any broader rollout.

**(1:37:00) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Finally, for **recycling**, we need to dramatically improve our current take-back program by making it more visible, providing clear incentives, and ensuring transparency about what happens to collected garments. Long-term, we should explore closed-loop recycling for specific product lines and investigate chemical or enzymatic recycling technologies for mixed fibers.

**(1:37:18) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** *[showing action plan slide]* Now for the concrete next steps. For resale: conduct detailed market analysis, develop a partnership strategy with existing platforms, and design a compelling brand identity for our pre-loved program. For repair: develop service menus and pricing strategies, identify space requirements in flagship stores, and create training programs for repair specialists.

**(1:37:38) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** We've outlined key success metrics for each initiative as well. For resale: take-back volume, resale revenue, customer acquisition through resale. For repair: service utilization rates, customer satisfaction with repairs, and incremental revenue.

**(1:37:52) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** In summary, we believe these circular strategies offer significant opportunities to enhance brand loyalty, create new revenue streams, and advance our sustainability goals. The key is phased implementation, starting with the most feasible options, while developing longer-term capabilities. Any questions?

**(1:38:08) Eleanor Vance (CEO):** Thank you, Liam. Excellent presentation. Let's open up for questions and discussion. This is an opportunity to build on these ideas, identify connections with other groups' work, and challenge assumptions.

**(1:38:20) Sarah Chen (Head of Sustainability):** I really appreciate the phased approach. One question about the repair services – have you considered mobile repair options or pop-ups? Not all markets have flagship stores, and this could be a way to extend the benefit to more customers.

**(1:38:33) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Great question. We did discuss mobile repair services briefly. Maria suggested that a repair van concept, while innovative, might be logistically complex initially. But we absolutely see potential in pop-up repair events, particularly in markets where we have smaller stores.

**(1:38:47) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** *[adding]* Yes, we could test repair pop-ups during specific campaign periods. Perhaps seasonally, when customers are transitioning their wardrobes and might need alterations or repairs.

**(1:38:57) Ben Carter (E-commerce Manager):** What about the digital side of these initiatives? Particularly for resale – would customers be able to list their pre-owned items directly on our platform, or would everything go through in-store take-back?

**(1:39:09) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Initially, we envisioned starting with in-store take-back only to maintain quality control. But Ethan made a strong point that many customers would prefer a digital option. Once we've established clear authentication processes and condition standards, a peer-to-peer marketplace component could be added to our platform.

**(1:39:25) Raj Patel (CIO/CTO):** That would tie in nicely with our digital transformation priorities. The technology for creating a peer-to-peer marketplace is fairly standard these days. My concern would be around verification and authentication at scale.

**(1:39:37) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** We discussed this briefly – digital product passports could help here. Essentially, unique identifiers for each garment that store information about its materials, manufacturing, purchase date, etc. This supports authentication for resale and helps with recycling at end-of-life.

**(1:39:52) Priya Sharma (Head of Marketing):** I'm curious about the branding strategy for the resale program. Did you discuss whether this would be integrated into our main brand or positioned as a sub-brand?

**(1:40:02) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** We leaned toward a sub-brand approach – something clearly connected to Sustainable Fashion Co. but with its own distinct identity. This allows us to appeal to a potentially different customer segment specifically interested in pre-owned fashion, while still maintaining a clear link to our parent brand.

**(1:40:17) Ethan Brown (Customer Service Representative):** We also felt that a slightly separate branding would help manage customer expectations regarding product condition and availability, which naturally differ between new and pre-owned items.

**(1:40:28) Carlos Silva (Quality Control Manager):** Regarding the repair program, what level of quality assurance did you discuss? My concern is consistency of repair quality, especially if we expand to multiple locations.

**(1:40:39) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** That's a valid concern, Carlos. We identified the need for standardized repair procedures, quality checks on completed repairs, and specific training programs. We didn't get into the granular details, but establishing a central repair excellence team to develop standards and training would be a logical next step.

**(1:40:55) Kenji Tanaka (Materials Sourcing Manager):** For the recycling initiative, did you consider how this connects to our materials strategy? Specifically, how we might eventually incorporate recycled fibers from our own take-back program into new products?

**(1:41:08) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Good question. We discussed this as a long-term aspiration – creating a true closed-loop system where fibers from our recycled garments go back into our supply chain. The technology isn't quite there yet for all materials, but it's definitely part of the vision. Actually, this is a perfect connection point with your group's work on materials innovation.

**(1:41:26) David Rodriguez (Head of Operations):** One operational concern: these circular initiatives, especially repair and take-back, will require physical space in stores. Did you discuss the space requirements and potential impact on the current store experience?

**(1:41:38) Maria Rodriguez (Retail Manager):** We did touch on this, David. For flagships, we estimated needing about 100 square feet for a repair station, positioned as a visible feature rather than hidden away. For take-back, the initial collection bins don't require much space, but as volume grows, we would need to consider backend storage logistics. This is why we recommended starting with select stores rather than a company-wide rollout.

**(1:41:57) Eleanor Vance (CEO):** These are all excellent points. I'm particularly interested in how these circular models might affect our core product strategy. Isabelle, did your group discuss whether designing for circularity might constrain your creative process?

**(1:42:12) Isabelle Dubois (Head of Design):** *[thoughtfully]* We did discuss this, Eleanor. Honestly, at first it felt constraining – designing with repair and resale in mind means focusing more on durability and timeless styles rather than just following trends. But actually, we came to see it as an evolution of our design ethos, not a limitation. It pushes us toward higher quality and more thoughtful design, which aligns with our brand values anyway. There might be some product categories where circularity is more challenging, but overall, we see it as pushing us in a positive direction.

**(1:42:40) Eleanor Vance (CEO):** That's reassuring. And Marcus, from a financial perspective, what's your take on the investment required versus potential returns?

**(1:42:49) Marcus Chen (CFO):** *[straightening]* The beauty of the phased approach is that it allows us to test and validate before significant capital commitment. Initial investments for the resale partnership model and limited repair services could be managed within existing budgets. The potential for new revenue streams is considerable – industry data suggests resale markets are growing 11 times faster than traditional retail. What I appreciate about this proposal is the balance between short-term feasibility and long-term ambition.

**(1:43:13) Eleanor Vance (CEO):** Thank you all for this robust discussion. Group 1, these are excellent recommendations and I appreciate the pragmatic approach to implementation. I'd like to see these circular initiatives incorporated into our broader strategy discussion during prioritization. Before we move on, any final thoughts from Group 1?

**(1:43:30) Liam O'Connell (Innovation Manager):** Just one closing thought: circularity isn't just about sustainability – it's about building deeper customer relationships across multiple touchpoints. When a customer buys, repairs, and eventually resells a garment with us, their lifetime value and brand loyalty significantly increase. So these initiatives support both our sustainability and business objectives.

**(1:43:48) Eleanor Vance (CEO):** Well said, Liam. Let's move on to Group 2 – Digital Transformation and Customer Experience. Raj, I believe you're presenting?
